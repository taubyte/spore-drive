# Spore Drive

**Spore Drive is a simple deployment tool for building a Taubyte cloud from your own servers.**

You give it:
- A hosts file (server IPs + access credentials)
- A Tau source (latest official build or your own custom build)

Spore Drive does the rest.

It installs, configures, and connects all servers into a single **Taubyte cloud**, automatically.



## What it actually does
- Provisions multiple servers at once
- Installs Tau on each node
- Connects nodes into a decentralized Taubyte fabric
- Turns raw servers into a working cloud

No manual node setup.  
No control plane to babysit.



## Who it’s for
- Teams deploying Taubyte on bare metal or VMs
- Self-hosted, private, or edge cloud setups
- Anyone who wants full control over infrastructure







## In one sentence
**Spore Drive turns a list of servers into a Taubyte cloud.**
